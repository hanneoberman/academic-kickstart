abstract: "How can we improve missing data handling? I have yet to come across an un-wrangled data set that dóésn't contain missing cells. Of course you could just ignore the problem and apply list-wise deletion, but that decreases power and can bias results. As Master's thesis project I will develop an evaluation suite (R Shiny) to assess missingness and multiple imputated data sets (R package 'MICE'). Before starting in september, I would love your feedback on what aspects I should not overlook, great examples of other evaluation suites (like ShinyStan), and what would improve your trust in multiple imputations! For more information, see work by Stef van Buuren (free e-book: stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/) and Gerko Vink."
