<p>This file describes how convergence diagnostic <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{R}\)</span> is computed in the simulation study I ran for my Research Report. <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{R}\)</span> is also called ‘potential scale reduction factor’. It tells us how much the variance of an estimate could be shrunken down if we would have infinitely many iterations.</p>
