This file describes how convergence diagnostic $\widehat{R}$ is computed in the simulation study I ran for my Research Report. $\widehat{R}$ is also called 'potential scale reduction factor'. It tells us how much the variance of an estimate could be shrunken down if we would have infinitely many iterations.
