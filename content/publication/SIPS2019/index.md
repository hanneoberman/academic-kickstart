publication_short: Missing Data Evaluation Suite
abstract: 'How can we improve missing data handling? I have yet to come across an
  un-wrangled data set that dóésn''t contain missing cells. Of course you could just
  ignore the problem and apply list-wise deletion, but that decreases power and can
  bias results. As Master''s thesis project I will develop an evaluation suite (R
  Shiny) to assess missingness and multiple imputated data sets (R package ''MICE'').
  Before starting in september, I would love your feedback on what aspects I should
  not overlook, great examples of other evaluation suites (like ShinyStan), and what
  would improve your trust in multiple imputations! For more information, see work
  by Stef van Buuren (free e-book: stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/) and Gerko Vink.'
